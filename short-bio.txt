My name is Alicia Fritz, and I am a student at Arizona State University working towards a MS in Complex Systems Science while residing in Phoenix, AZ. Before attending ASU for my undergrad and now grad degree, I earned my AS and AA with highest distinction and honors from Phoenix College. During my time at PC, I had the opportunity to be a part of the S-STEM Train program for two semesters, developing two research projects: the socioeconomic impact of marigold in Mesoamerica and social inequality through network models. I also received a certificate of completion as a STEM-CURE research assistant for publishing original research with a team. At ASU, I continued to do research by participating in three research apprenticeship programs spanning a diverse range of topics. Currently, outside of attending classes at ASU, I work as the STEAM Project Manager at PC. When I am not at school or working, you can find me reading as much as I can, wishing it was Halloween, and looking for new museums to visit.
My birthday is on June 6th, 2000 making me a gemini according to the zodiac calendar.

I love to read!
